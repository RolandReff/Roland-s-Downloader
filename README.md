This is a personal project made and designed to simplify the process of downloading vidoes 
from various websites usin pytube and youtube-dl. 


## Functions
Download youtube videos in the following formats with Pytube:
- MP4
- Mp3


## Bugs
- Encountring an error that crashes the script on my desktop at the moment of creating the path for downloaded 
  video, due to WinError 5 and 13, can be fixed if you run the script with the following on win10 Home 64-bit,
  "python -i PATH\main.py",seems to be a local problem, based on the fact it runs perfectly on my laptop
  which is running Win11 Home 64-bit. Has to be tested on other devices.
